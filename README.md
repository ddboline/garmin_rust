This started as a bash script to help keeping track of binary activity files downloaded from a Garmin Forerunner 310 GPS watch, it evolved into a python application to display summary information, gained a hacky web interface, and became something I used on a daily basis. [The python application still lives](https://github.com/ddboline/garmin_app), but this is a rewrite of that python code into rust, the rewrite includes some substantial improvements, it's still a work in progress, and will likely always be.
